# About me
Hey! I'm Madhav. I started tinkering with programming when I was 13 with an arduino(yes, I learnt the word tinkering from Massimo Banzi's book) to blink lights, and the curiosity to learn more has been ever since. I graduated in engineering in 2021. However, not a lot was learnt during it. Here I plan to write about what I learn from reading on my own and about what I build and maybe some ranting ??!!

 Other than technical interests, I like lifting and playing guitar(miserably).
 
  If you're reading this, welcome to my blog ! :D
