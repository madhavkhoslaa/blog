description: "SOLID Patterns are a general guideline and reccomended pattenrns that you can use in your codebase to be extensable, easy to modify in future and easy to fix. These aren't hard bound rules just general reccomendations. Here, I'll talk about them in detail."

SOLID is just an acronym for a few principles that Robert C. Martin. SOLID Design princples aim to make your code base extensible, easy to modify in future, easy to debug and fix. They are not RULES just a bunch of thought ideas of seggregation of logic and how to organise your code. 

**S** => [Single Responsibility Principle](#Single-Responsibility-Principle)  
**O** => [Open Close Princple](#Open-Close-Princple)  
**L** => [Liskov Substitution Principle](#Liskov-Substitution-Principle)  
**I** => [Interface Segregation Principle](#Interface-Segregation-Principle)  
**D** => [Dependency Injection](#Dependency-Injection)
