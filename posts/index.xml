It solves problems like null pointers, dangling pointers and data races without a garbage collector at the run time.
Understanding Rust Ownership How is data stored in the program? Stack Heap Data(variables in function arguments and defined) in the stack have a known type hence the size of the data in the stack is known at the time of compilation.</description></item><item><title>Creational Design Patterns: My lessons on it</title><link>https://madhavkhoslaa.github.io/posts/ceationaldesignpatterns/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://madhavkhoslaa.github.io/posts/ceationaldesignpatterns/</guid><description>Creational Design Patterns Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
Why were they made and why should you care about reading them? You must have noticed in a larger code base where multiple classes dealing with the class instantiation becomes too hard, in fact in the case of languages like java where the ecosystem expects everything to be a class; a framework called spring had been developed to solve the problem of instantiating classes(and so much more).</description></item><item><title>SOLID Patterns: My lessons on it</title><link>https://madhavkhoslaa.github.io/posts/solid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 04:01:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://madhavkhoslaa.github.io/posts/solid/</guid><description>SOLID is just an acronym for a few principles that Robert C. Martin compiled together. SOLID Design principles aim to make your code base extensible, easy to modify in the future, and easy to debug and fix. They are not rules just a bunch of thought ideas of segregation of logic and how to organize your code.

Being cheap and easy to implement on the top of a existing system it also brings some problems such as invalidation and infrastructure for setting up the cache itself. Here I plan to talk about some lessons on caching that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt in a few months.
